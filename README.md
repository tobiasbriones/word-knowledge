App that lets you play word games for fun or practicing languages.

Word Knowledge is a database to collect words classified by a category and
subcategory, and it is an app to play word knowledge games so that the user can
practice foreign-language words they have learned or just have fun, as well as
accessing information about the words and interacting with other users.

The first development released version, Word Knowledge v0.1.0 is what I coded
back in 2015 and then enhanced a little so that I may publish the release.

#### Disclaimer

The v0.1.0 was created just to practice my new skills about creating web pages
with JS, PHP, and MySQL. Thus, the version contains old code from 2015 which
used to run in PHP 5.x and does not have very good programming practices, code
quality, design or database normalization since it was just a practice for web
development and to apply programming to my English studies.

## My Story

My days back in 2015 were all about learning many new things. I started learning
many other programming languages and technologies for web development, say,
jQuery, PHP, MySQL, and stuff. On the other hand, I was strengthening my math
background of course! by taking advantage that I was out-of-school those days
and so that I had time to *study* and learn instead of being losing my valuable
time in the meaningless dysfunctional education system we were enforced to pass
by. I was also learning English and that way sitting in front of my old piece of
computer that I had is where there in lays my initiative to create something to
practice my new skills, useful for learning English and being something easy to
develop, it was a web app called *Word Knowledge* for playing with words and see
if you know what they mean in your native/second language. I was adding more new
words to the database and also adding new features to the app and that's why I
didn't finish it because I'm always adding and thinking about new ideas, and
it's hard to keep up with that!.
