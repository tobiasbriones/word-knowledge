App that lets you play word games for fun or practicing languages.

Word Knowledge is a database to collect words classified by a category and subcategory, and it is an
app to play word knowledge games so that the user can practice foreign-language words they have
learned or just have fun, as well as accessing information about the words and interacting with
other users.

The first development released version, Word Knowledge v0.1.0 is what I coded back in 2015 and then
enhanced a little so that I may publish the release.

#### Disclaimer

The v0.1.0 was created just to practice my new skills about creating web pages with JS, PHP, and
MySQL. Thus, the version contains old code from 2015 which used to run in PHP 5.x and does not have
very good programming practices, code quality, design or database normalization since it was just a
practice for web development and to apply programming to my English studies.

## My Story

My days back in 2015 were all about learning many new things. I started learning many other
programming languages and technologies for web development, say, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, and stuff. On
the other hand, I was strengthening my maths background of course! by taking advantage that I was
out-of-school those days and so that I had time to *study* and learn instead of being losing my
valuable time in the meaningless dysfunctional education system we were enforced to pass by. I was
also learning English and that way sitting in front of my old piece of computer that I had is where
there in lays my initiative to create something to practice my new skills, useful for learning
English and being something easy to develop, it was a web app called *Word Knowledge* for playing
with words and see if you know what they mean in your native/second language. I was adding more new
words to the database and also adding new features to the app and that's why I didn't finish it
because I'm always adding and thinking about new ideas, and it's hard to keep up with that!.
